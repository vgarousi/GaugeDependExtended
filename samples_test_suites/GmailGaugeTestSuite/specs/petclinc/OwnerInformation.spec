# Owner Information Systematic
Created by Cameron on 7/12/2020

This is an exexutable specification file which follows markdown syntax
Every Heading denotes a test. Every bulleted point denotes a step
.....................................................................

There are 4 types of test cases:
    1-Transition from the current node (webpage) to the neighboring nodes (webpages)
    2-Node tp itself (Like form validation)
    3-Input UI tests (in single node/page/unit level)
    4-End to end testing

I will activily use the flow-diagram of web pages for test-case design
.......................................................................
Counts for this spec file:

Node-2-node = 4

Total = 4
